this notes is helping to remember certain sort of the things that i learn in the js tutorial by super simple dev

documnet.body.innerHTML = "string_to_be_entered";
this line in the js code will remove all the elements in the body of the html and display only the string present inside the double notations (" ")

the documnet object is releats with the documnet of the page , so using documnet object we can able to change the properties of the page
example : documnet.title = ' the title to be changed ' now the title of the webpage is changed
the documnet object represents the page ( documnet object model  ) DOM 

the documnet.querySelector('.class_attribute_name') is used to select the class from the html elements
